### How do I approach designing software?

When I'm designing software, I'll begin by thinking about what problem I'm trying to solve with my software. This will help to give me an idea for what it will ultimately end up looking like. Using this knowledge, I'll next determine which objects are likely to be needed and function those objects will perform. This will help me to determine how they should interact as well. I'll continue to revisit the design throughout the development process to ensure that what I'm creating is consistent with the original software needs.

Beyond the original plan, I'll also treat design as itertive. It is likely that as development progresses, modifications to the original design will be needed. It is good to have an original plan, but I also think it's a wise to be flexibile with those original plans if improvements can be incorporated.
  
### How do I approach developing programs?

I prefer to develop software in small chunks at a time. After I finish creating a section of my code, I'll test it to see if it's functioning as intended. Additionally, this will help to ensure that code that I add didn't break any older code as well. I'll continue this iterative development process (i.e., code a section then test it) through the development process.

The program created in this class gave me the chance to practice these skills on a larger and more complex code base than I've been able to in the past. I've gained skills in iteratively adding functionality to and developing code without breaking anything previously developed while still maintaining a high level of code efficiency.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I believe the skills gained in this class will greatly help me in my future. Much of the software written today has some form of graphical representation or visualization. While it may not always be developed using OpenGL, the concepts and skills gained from this course will help me to understand and work with any graphics library in the future.
